# Test

The test are written using [ava]() and [supertest]()

## Samples

Sample tests from [bitbucket-server-nodejs](https://github.com/sternba/bitbucket-server-nodejs) can be found in `test/sample` and used for refeence and inspiration to set up the basic test infrastructure, for mocks etc.

Also, perhaps use [sinon]() to simulate successful authentication, responses etc.
